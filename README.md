# DontBeStupid
Over the fifteen years or so that I have been part of the competitive gaming community, I have seen no shortage of blatant stupidity which plagues the forums and subreddits for those games. Efforts to dispel some of the fallacies and misunderstandings that are often used in these communities has been largely unsuccessful outside of my GuidWarsWiki pages (which nobody visits anymore as that game is dead). Whenever anyone posts anything remotely critical in reddit, it gets immediately banned. Therefore, I have decided to collect this information here.

Let's go!

## "It's fine because it's in the game"

This is one of the easiest arguments to counter. Whenever you criticize a feature or component of a game, call something overpowered or broken, or say something's designed badly, there is, unfailingly, a group of retards who hop onto the thread and respond with this gem. Some of the more common responses are:

- It's fine because it's in the game.
- (for MOBAs) It's fine because that's his kit.
- (Rocket League) Infinite boost is fine because your car has a rocket strapped to it.
- If it wasn't fine, the devs wouldn't have put it in.
- A company made it, so it must be good.

People who say these things are assuming ALL of the following:

- People who designed the game are perfect and never make mistakes.
- People who programmed the game are perfect and never make mistakes.
- The game has impenetrable security layers to prevent hacking/cheating.
- The devs thought of literally every situation.

This argument can also be applied to everything. This is a tell-tale sign that your argument sucks:
- It's ok for this champ to be permanently invincible and have 1-hit kills, because that's his kit.
- It's ok to exploit this infinite health bug, because it's in the game.
- It's ok for people to use aimhack/wallhack, because it's in the game.

Needless to say, if you believe all of those things, you're pretty fucking stupid.

The reality is, game developers aren't perfect. All of them are human. All of them make mistakes. Some of those mistakes won't get caught. Additionally, some game designers are grossly incompetent, and either nobody else at their company is aware of this, or they don't have the power to do anything about it.

## Loss Aversion

You'll hear this one when a game update is coming down the pipe, or has just been released.
